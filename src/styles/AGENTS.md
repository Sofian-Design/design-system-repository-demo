# Theme Assets Guidelines

This file inherits the repository root `AGENTS.md`. Generated theme assets live in this directory.

- `engage.css` and `legacy.css` are produced by `scripts/generate-design-tokens.mjs`; do not edit them manually.
- `tokens.generated.ts` surfaces runtime metadata for theme selection and is regenerated by the same script.
- Run `yarn generate:tokens` after updating any design token exports to refresh these files before committing.

## Functional Changes
- 2025-09-30: Added layered `index.css`, theme helpers, and scoped CSS selectors so `data-fivra-theme` toggles Engage/Legacy tokens.
