# Components Documentation Guidelines

This directory inherits the repository and `docs/` guidance. Keep component reference pages synchronized with the implementation and Storybook examples.

- Favor task-oriented sections: overview, usage, accessibility, theming, and web component registration.
- Link directly to source files and stories using relative paths when possible.
- Update the "Functional Changes" section below whenever documentation changes to reflect new component behavior.

## Functional Changes
